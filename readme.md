# CSS Extractor

CSS Extractor is an innovative tool designed to optimize your web development process. It detects classes from an HTML file and extracts those classes from a CSS file. This is particularly useful when you're working with minified CSS files generated by build tools like Vite or Vue Loader in Vue.js projects. Using a pre-rendered HTML file as a reference, CSS Extractor streamlines the process of identifying and extracting the specific CSS classes you need.

## How Does It Work?

CSS Extractor operates in several stages:

1. **HTML Preparation**: It starts by reading your HTML file, removing any unwanted elements and attributes, and saving the cleaned-up version.

2. **HTML Analysis**: It then analyzes the cleaned HTML, extracting all the unique class names, IDs, and tags.

3. **CSS Crawling**: After the HTML analysis, CSS Extractor goes through all your CSS files, removing unwanted attributes, and creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) from each CSS file.

4. **CSS Filtering**: It filters the AST based on the unique class names, IDs, and tags identified from the HTML analysis. The result is a collection of relevant CSS rules.

5. **CSS Output**: Lastly, it combines all the relevant CSS rules from each CSS file into one final CSS file, which only includes the CSS rules used in the HTML file.

This process can be extremely helpful for removing redundant or unused CSS, reducing the size of your CSS files, and improving the performance of your web pages.

## Installation

To install CSS Extractor, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

With Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/css-extractor.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd css-extractor
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the following npm scripts:

- **start**: Runs the CSS extraction process:
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
- **explain**: Generates a detailed explanation of the project's codebase:
  ```
  npm run explain
  ```
- **clear:output**, **clear:input**, **clear:all**: Clear the output and/or input directories:
  ```
  npm run clear:output
  npm run clear:input
  npm run clear:all
  ```

Please note that the **start** script runs the CSS extraction process, which requires HTML and CSS files to be present in the input directory. The result will be a CSS file in the output directory containing only the CSS rules used in the HTML file.

## Project Status

CSS Extractor is currently in beta stage. While it is already functional and can significantly aid in your web development process, there is still a lot of room for improvement. We're continuously working to enhance its performance, user experience, and the accuracy of its extraction process. We appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have.
